# Note
This KEYS game was made as my final project in my first programming course. It features a Save System, persistent inventory, and a really bad story line.
I was still feeling my way through how programming even worked, so I ended up making a lot of functions, which was a weird way to make this, but it was pretty cool I suppose. I'm proud of the project for its size, but am aware there are some bad elements I made back then.
